Hello makers in this video I have made a arduino based auto label dispenser machine, this machine dispense labels automatically.
When you are in packaging and transporting industry there are continue parcel which need to label some sticker, this machine very much helpful there, it automatically peel off label and dispense this make process fast.
For this I used arduino micro controller, stepper motor to feed label roll and IR sensor to detect label
